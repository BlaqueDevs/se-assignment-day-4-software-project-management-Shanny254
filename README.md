## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?

ANSWER:

Comparison of Agile and Waterfall Methodologies

1. Agile is an iterative and flexible approach, where development happens in short cycles (sprints), allowing for continuous feedback and adaptation. In contrast, Waterfall follows a sequential and structured process, where all requirements are defined upfront, and each phase (design, development, testing, deployment) is completed before moving to the next.
2. One key difference is how they handle project scope. Agile allows for evolving requirements, making it ideal for projects where needs may change over time. Waterfall, on the other hand, works best when the project scope is fixed and well-defined from the start.
3. In terms of delivery, Agile focuses on incremental releases, meaning the customer sees working software early and often. Waterfall delivers the entire project as a complete package at the end, which can delay feedback.
4. Another contrast is in customer involvement. Agile relies heavily on frequent customer feedback, ensuring the final product aligns with user needs. Waterfall requires minimal customer interaction after initial requirements gathering, which can sometimes lead to mismatched expectations.
5. Testing in Agile is an ongoing process, helping to catch and fix issues early. Waterfall, however, conducts testing only after development is completed, which can make it costly to correct mistakes.

Advantages and Disadvantages

Agile Advantages:

1. Highly flexible and adaptable to changes.
2. Encourages continuous customer feedback, reducing the risk of delivering an unsatisfactory product.
3. Detects and resolves issues early through regular testing and iteration.
4. Faster time-to-market with early functional releases.

Agile Disadvantages:

1. Harder to predict costs and timelines due to evolving requirements.
2. Requires active customer involvement, which may not always be feasible.
3. Can become chaotic if not properly managed, leading to scope creep.

Waterfall Advantages:

1. Provides a clear structure and well-defined scope, making planning straightforward.
2. Easier to manage for large projects with strict requirements.
3. Works well for projects that require regulatory compliance and detailed documentation.
4. Suitable for projects with stable requirements that are unlikely to change.

Waterfall Disadvantages:

1. Difficult to adapt if changes are needed after development has started.
2. Major issues may only be discovered late in the process, leading to high costs for fixing them.
3. Takes longer before the customer sees a working product, which can delay feedback and improvements.
